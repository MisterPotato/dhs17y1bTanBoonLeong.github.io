<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi! I am Tan Boon Leong, a 13-year-old student from <a href="http://www.dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg">DunmanHighSchool</a>,Singapore.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>I like to draw, cycle and most of all, eat! :9 Drawing makes me relaxed and happy. Cycling helps me destress and at the same time enjoy the scenery. Eating helps to relieve stress and it makes me want to eat more! :9 </p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>I am doing <a href="http://codein.withgoogle.com">Google Code-in 2016</a> with <a href="http://fossasia.org">FOSSASIA</a>!</p>
