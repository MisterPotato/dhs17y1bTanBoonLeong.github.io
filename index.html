<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hi! I am Tan Boon Leong, a 13-year-old student from <a href="http://www.dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg">DunmanHighSchool</a>,Singapore.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>I like to draw, cycle, play online games, and most of all, eat! :9 Drawing makes me relaxed and happy. Cycling helps me destress and at the same time enjoy the scenery.<a href= "https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwigz8PrvsPTAhVMsI8KHd-1DnoQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fclashofclans.wikia.com%2F&psig=AFQjCNGdbc2JrMh2keGhcwT2dI-ewkBr0Q&ust=1493343120814403">Playing games</a> makes me happy and allows me to communicate with my online friends and other online players to make friends. Eating helps to relieve stress and it makes me want to eat more! :9 </p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>I am doing <a href="http://codein.withgoogle.com">Google Code-in 2016</a> with <a href="http://fossasia.org">FOSSASIA</a>!</p>
