<h1>Science Project</h1>
<p>Hi! I am Tan Boon Leong, a 13-year-old student from <a href="http://www.dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg">Dunman High School</a>,Singapore. I am doing a Science Project on the <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjGxKvv8YnUAhVLto8KHd7SB3oQFgglMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Flkcnhm.nus.edu.sg%2F&usg=AFQjCNG_hDDUiq5v-_ERmyLbvMjgm203DQ&sig2=UIt3ZUIXZiEI4rHnGjUzFw"> Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, Singapore </a></p>
  <h2>Inside the Museum</h2>
  <p>I saw a colossal skeleton of a <a href= "https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiSnpH69YnUAhXKvI8KHZTECk8QFgggMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Flkcnhm.nus.edu.sg%2Fnus%2Findex.php%2Fcollections%2Fsgwhale&usg=AFQjCNF7ydgGC2sBy0x6kG2BsWc2JcLPRg&sig2=9r0Mt80U87icnegjTa7ohQ">Sperm Whale</a> exhibited near the entrance! It was just sooooooooo big! I was amazed by the sheer size of it. However, on of its bones from its spine was broken. It might be because a loose motor blad had fallen off a boat while turning at full speed and unfortunately the sharp blade cut into the Sperm Whale's tail and therefore destroyed the spin bone.</p>
